# MUSIFY - Music-Composition-using-AI (May, 2022- July,2022)
The Project has been developed to create new piece of music from Piano Notes using Machine Learning packages .

## About the Project

* **Platform** : Visual Studio Code 
* **Language** : Python 3.8
* **Libraries Used** : Tensorflow, Music21, Keras, NumPy, Sklearn, tqdm
* **Dataset** : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi

## File Structure
* **Midi Files** : This is the dataset folder containing various midi(music) files of different composers.
* **code.ipynb** : This is the main file of code where we have built , trained and tested the model.
* **MOD** : This directory contains optimizer, metrics, and weights of our trained model.
* **AI_composed_music.mid** : This is a music file generated with the predicted output notes.
* **SOC| Learning Project | Musify | Aryan** : This is the report and the documentation of my project.
* **Musify** : This is a power point presentation which describes the idea , code and learning behinf the project .
* **MusifyVideo** : This is the video which I have made for the project describing the project .

## Steps
Follow the steps and compose music using AI

* **STEP 1** : Download the files from the repository by clicking on **Code** button
* **STEP 2** : Install Libraries using pip command (In Anaconda Prompt)
* **STEP 3** : Open **code.ipynb** file using Jupyter Notebook / Visual Studio Code
* **STEP 4** : Run all the cells one by one and check the output
* **STEP 5** : Wait for the model training as it takes about 7-8 hours
* **STEP 6** : Run the last cell and a file named as **AI_composed_music.mid** will be saved
* **STEP 7** : Play the file **AI_composed_music.mid**
You have composed your own music by using AI. Some of the parameters can be tweaked in the code for different results.
